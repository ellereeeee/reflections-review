Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When you want a backup of your work, when you want other people to see your work, or when you're collaborating on a project.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with 
your remote repository?

A: If you're collaborating on a project, updates from another collaborator could constantly interfere with any code you write.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A: Is a fork is a copy of a remote repository that is hosted on Github's servers. 
It is the same thing is only, except all data exists online. 
You use it when you want to work on someone else's code but don't have permission to change the original. 
This also properly credits the author of the original code, 
whereas cloning the code would not explicitly credit the original author.

A clone is a copy of a remote repository on your local computer. 
You could use this way to copy code where crediting is not an issue, 
perhaps such as some open-source projects(?) or a collaborative work project.

A branch is a history of commits in a repository. 
The main one is called the "master" branch and exists in all repositories. 
You would use it when collaborating on a project, 
when you want to keep a production version of a project intact while adding updates, 
or working on a new feature of a project.
