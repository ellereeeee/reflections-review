Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When you want a backup of your work, when you want other people to see your work, or when you're collaborating on a project.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with 
your remote repository?

A: If you're collaborating on a project, updates from another collaborator could constantly interfere with any code you write.
